Hello! I'm @NotInsertIGN, and I am a professional Java person! I am fluent in over twelve languages, including Java (best language), Python, Ruby, Swift, C++, C#, and C (not bragging I swear)

I generally work on projects related to @HypixelDev and my own websites. I also make cool applications, some of which are public on the GitHub :O

Controversial Opinions:
  Maven > Gradle
  Python is a little cringe
