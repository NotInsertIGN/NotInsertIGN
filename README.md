Hello! I'm @NotInsertIGN, and I am a somewhat okay Java person-type-thing! I am fluent in over twelve languages, including Java (best), Python, Ruby, Swift, all of the .NET family, Dart, Go, Scala, and a few more (not bragging I swear)

I generally work on projects related to @HypixelDev and my own websites. I also make cool applications, some of which are public on the GitHub :O

Controversial Opinions:

  Maven > Gradle

  Python < Java
